    "# 🧠 **MACHINE LEARNING–BASED PREDICTIVE MODELLING OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION FOR ONLINE LEARNING AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Purpose of This Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a structured, transparent, and fully reproducible environment for developing a machine learning model that predicts online learning adoption among university students, focusing on the role of social media and emerging technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It mirrors the logic implemented in `model_pipeline.py` and expands it with detailed explanations, exploratory visualisations, interpretability outputs, and narrative required for academic documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook supports the **Research Methodology** and **Results and Evaluation** chapters by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Presenting the complete research-oriented machine learning workflow,\n",
    "* Justifying preprocessing and feature engineering decisions,\n",
    "* Comparing multiple models using sound evaluation criteria,\n",
    "* Interpreting model behaviour with SHAP and LIME,\n",
    "* Generating deployment artifacts used in the Streamlit prediction app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How to Use This Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read sequentially to understand the full modelling process.\n",
    "* Markdown cells explain the rationale behind each step; code cells implement it.\n",
    "* Running the notebook regenerates all model artifacts used by the Streamlit application:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `best_model.joblib`\n",
    "  * `scaler.joblib`\n",
    "  * `label_encoders.joblib`\n",
    "  * `feature_list.json`\n",
    "  * `model_performance.json`\n",
    "  * SHAP and LIME interpretability files\n",
    "* Visualizations and tables can be exported directly to support thesis chapters and appendices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Running the Streamlit App**\n",
    "\n",
    "After generating artifacts via this notebook or by running `model_pipeline.py`, launch the interactive prediction interface using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "streamlit run streamlit_app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The app supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch predictions** from CSV/XLSX datasets\n",
    "* **Single-learner ad-hoc ## 8. Model Deployment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate practical application and stakeholder engagement beyond batch processing, a complementary interactive web application has been developed using Streamlit. This deployment interface leverages the serialized artifacts (preprocessing transformers, feature ordering, and champion model) generated by the pipeline, enabling end-users—such as educators, administrators, or researchers—to obtain real-time predictions without requiring programming expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Streamlit App\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this notebook (or running `model_pipeline.py`) to produce the required artifacts in the `artifacts/` directory, the application can be launched locally with the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "streamlit run streamlit_app.py**\n",
    "* Visual interpretability (SHAP & LIME)\n",
    "* Download of prediction outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The full **Streamlit code (`streamlit_app.py`)** is included in this notebook’s Appendix.\n",

    "\n",
    "The proliferation of digital learning platforms has transformed educational delivery, yet adoption remains uneven across populations. Understanding the factors that drive individuals to engage in e-learning is critical for designing effective interventions and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study employs supervised machine learning to predict whether respondents are **currently involved in e-learning**, using survey items aligned with established behavioral theories—particularly the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).\n",

    "- Identify key predictors of e-learning adoption.\n",
    "- Develop high-performing and interpretable classification models.\n",

    "## 8. Model Deployment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate practical application and stakeholder engagement beyond batch processing, a complementary interactive web application has been developed using Streamlit. This deployment interface leverages the serialized artifacts (preprocessing transformers, feature ordering, and champion model) generated by the pipeline, enabling end-users—such as educators, administrators, or researchers—to obtain real-time predictions without requiring programming expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Running the Streamlit App\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this notebook (or running `model_pipeline.py` included in Appendix A) to produce the required artifacts in the `artifacts/` directory, the application (included in Appendix B) can be launched locally with the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "streamlit run streamlit_app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Discussion of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The champion model demonstrated robust performance, with engineered TAM-based constructs consistently ranking among the most influential features—providing empirical support for theoretical frameworks. SHAP analyses revealed nuanced non-linear relationships and interactions, while LIME offered instance-level transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations include reliance on self-reported data, potential keyword-matching imprecision in feature aggregation, and moderate sample size. Future work could incorporate longitudinal data or advanced natural language processing for item grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research successfully developed an accurate and highly interpretable machine learning system for predicting e-learning adoption.

    "### D. Dataset Source and Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "No new primary data were collected for this study. The analysis utilizes secondary data extracted from the open-access supplementary material associated with a prior study published in the National Library of Medicine (PMC).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset file: `ODL 900.xlsx` (derived from the original supplementary Excel file).\n",
    "- Original source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/7334404/bin/mmc1.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "The data were originally collected by an independent research team through an online questionnaire administered to university students across Nigeria. As the dataset is publicly available under open access for academic and non-commercial research purposes, its secondary use in this thesis complies with ethical standards for reuse of publicly shared research data.\n",
